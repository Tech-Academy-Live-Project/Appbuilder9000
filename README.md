# AppBuilder9000
We're creating apps designed to take advantage of various Python and Django features.  We'll create databases to keep track of data, interact with APIs to retrieve data, use data scraping to collect and aggregate data, and more.  This project is built using Python, Django, SQLite, and HTML/CSS.
